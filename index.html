        <h2>Why Tech?</h2>
        <p>
            I developed interest in Tech as a result of the fast evolving Technology all around us,and as path to bring practical idea from 
            the healthcare system and help contribute to the development of applications and softwares that will help ease the workload,
            hence enabling more time for <ins>one-on-one care</ins>.

        <h3>Healthcare challenges today.</h3>
        <p><!--challenges faced in Healthcare!-->
            <mark>Shortage of qualifified workers</mark> has increasingly been one of the thoughest challenges faced in healthcare especially in <b><em>Old Peoples care</b></em>.
            <i>Geriatric</i> nursing goes beyond just caring for the aged as proper documentation is highly and essentially necessary. This helps keep track of not just the 
            medical history, but also <strong><mark>nutrition</strong></mark> and <strong><mark>socialization</strong></mark> and in turn serves as an emergency document when such arises.
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark>Time!!</mark> <pre></pre>
            Time has contiually been proven to not be on anyones side and the Healthcare is not spared. As a result of having so much to do 
            around the optimal care of the Aged, one is left daily with little or no time to sit and have proper conversation with them which 
            inturn provides them company and reassurance that they are not alone.
